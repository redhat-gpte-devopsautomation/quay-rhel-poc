[source,sh]
----
$ sudo podman rm -f quay
----
. Edit config file, change the below from false to true
+
[source,sh]

----
. Run the repomirror container
+
[source,sh]
----
$ sudo podman run -d --name mirroring-worker   -v $QUAY/config:/conf/stack:Z   -v /root/ca.crt:/etc/pki/ca-trust/source/anchors/ca.crt:Z   registry.redhat.io/quay/quay-rhel8:v3.7.8 repomirror
----
. Start the quay registry
+

. In the Mirror tab, enter the details for connecting to the external registry, along with the tags, scheduling and access information

* Registry Location: The external repository you want to mirror, for example, *registry.redhat.io/quay/quay-rhel8*
* Tags: *v3.7.8,v3.7.?* 
+
This field is required. You may enter a comma-separated list of individual tags or tag patterns. (See Tag Patterns section for details.)
+
[NOTE]
====
In order for Quay to get the list of tags in the remote repository, one of the following requirements must be met:

An image with the "latest" tag must exist in the remote repository OR
At least one explicit tag, without pattern matching, must exist in the list of tags that you specify
====

* Start Date: The date on which mirroring begins. The current date and time is used by default.
* Sync Interval: Defaults to syncing every 24 hours. You can change that based on hours or days.
* Robot User: Create a new robot account or choose an existing robot account to do the mirroring.
* Username: The username for accessing the external registry holding the repository you are mirroring.
* Password: The password associated with the Username. Note that the password cannot include characters that require an escape character (\).
