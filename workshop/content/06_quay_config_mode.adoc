== Run Quay in config mode

Before running the Red Hat Quay service, you need to generate a configuration file that has details of all the components, including registry settings, and database and Redis connection parameters. 

. To generate a configuration file, run the Quay container in config mode, specifying a password, for example, the string `secret`.
+
[source,sh]
----
$ sudo podman run --rm -it --name quay_config -p 80:8080 -p 443:8443 registry.redhat.io/quay/quay-rhel8:v3.7.8 config secret
----

. Make sure you add the entry for `quay-server.example.com` in your `/etc/hosts` file. 
+
[source,sh]
----
[nroy@nealwork ~]$ cat /etc/hosts
127.0.0.1   localhost localhost.localdomain localhost4 localhost4.localdomain4
::1         localhost localhost.localdomain localhost6 localhost6.localdomain6
52.118.31.6 quay-server.example.com
----
Where `52.118.31.6` is the public IP of the VM which was provisioned, *for you this IP will be different*. You have received your public IP in the separate email when you provisioned your lab environment. Use the same IP here.

. Use your laptop’s browser to access the user interface for the configuration tool at http://quay-server.example.com

. Log in with the username quayconfig and password secret, or whatever values were specified in the podman run command above.

=== Red Hat Quay setup for generating configuration file

. In the web UI, enter the below details before generating the config file
    * Basic configuration
    ** Don’t change, use default values.
    * Server configuration
    ** enter `quay-server.example.com`
    * Database
    ** For the purpose of this exercise, enter the below
    *** Database Type: `Postgres`
    *** Database Server: `quay-server.example.com:5432`
    *** Username: `quayuser`
    *** Password: `quaypass`
    *** Database Name: `quay`
    * Redis
    ** Redis Hostname: `quay-server.example.com`
    ** Redis port: 6379 (default)
    ** Redis password: `strongpassword`
        
. When all required fields have been set, validate your settings by clicking Validate Configuration Changes. If any errors are reported, continue editing your configuration until all required fields are valid and Red Hat Quay can connect to your database and Redis servers.

. Once your configuration is valid, download the configuration file. Following screenshot shows a successful validation.

=== Stop the Quay container
* Stop the Quay container that is running the configuration editor. 
* You can use ctrl+c if your container is running in the foreground, it takes around 30 secs to terminate it.
