NOTE: If you don't see this section then refresh the webpage once. If you still don't see it, verify that your mirroring-worker container is running

. In the Mirror tab, enter the details for connecting to the external registry, along with the tags, scheduling and access information

* Registry Location: The external repository you want to mirror, for example, *registry.redhat.io/quay/quay-rhel8*
* Tags: *v3.7.8,v3.7.?* 
+
This field is required. You may enter a comma-separated list of individual tags or tag patterns. 
+
[NOTE]
====
In order for Quay to get the list of tags in the remote repository, one of the following requirements must be met:

An image with the "latest" tag must exist in the remote repository OR
At least one explicit tag, without pattern matching, must exist in the list of tags that you specify
====

* Start Date: The date on which mirroring begins. The current date and time is used by default.
* Sync Interval: Defaults to syncing every 24 hours. You can change that based on hours or days.
* Robot User: Create a new robot account or choose an existing robot account to do the mirroring.
** To create a robot account click on the dropdown of the `Robot User` field and select `Create robot account`
** Enter a name for your robot account and select the `Create robot account` button
* Username: The username for accessing the external registry holding the repository you are mirroring. This will be the same username by which you authenticated against registry.redhat.io (for this example). If you didn't have this username created at the beginning of this course, you can create it by visiting https://access.redhat.com/terms-based-registry/
* Password: The password associated with the Username. Note that the password cannot include characters that require an escape character (\).
