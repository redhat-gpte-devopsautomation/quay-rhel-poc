== Red Hat Quay Superuser
A superuser is a Quay user account that has extended privileges, including the ability to:

    * Manage users
    * Manage organizations
    * Manage service keys
    * View the change log
    * Query the usage logs
    * Create globally visible user messages

=== Add the superuser
. Edit the config.yaml file to include the SUPER_USERS directive. Currently we have the user quayadmin created, include it in the list as shown below.
+
[source,sh]
----
$ cd $QUAY/config
$ vim config.yaml (add the superusers array only)
SERVER_HOSTNAME: quay.example.com
SETUP_COMPLETE: true
SUPER_USERS:
  - quayadmin
----

. Restart the Quay registry. It might take about a minute for the application to be available after container restarts:
+
[source,sh]
----
$ sudo podman restart quay
----

. Access the Super User Admin Panel by clicking on the current userâ€™s name or avatar in the top right-hand corner of the UI. If the user has been added as a superuser, an extra item is presented in the drop-down list called Super User Admin Panel.

=== Restricting user creation

. Recall, that when you login to the Red Hat Quay landing page, there's a `Create Account` option. You used this option earlier to create the `quayadmin` user.

. If you don't disable this then anyone can sign up to the registry if they just know the URL of the registry.

. Disable this user creation method by setting the FEATURE_USER_CREATION flag to `false`. Edit the config file only to change this one line
+
[source,sh]
----
$ cd $QUAY/config
$ vim config.yaml 
FEATURE_USER_CREATION: false
----
This field was previously set to true, change it to false.

. Restart the Quay registry:
+
[source,sh]
----
$ sudo podman restart quay
----
. Launch the web page again and notice that the `Create Account` option is not visible anymore.
